## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

   - Solution: Start with 3-4 platforms, add more gradually

   - Solution: Use the provided tracker, fill it out daily

3. **Staying at beginner rates too long**
   - Solution: Raise rates every 20-30 reviews/jobs

4. **Ignoring taxes**
   - Solution: Set aside 25-30% from Day 1

5. **Burning out in Month 1**
   - Solution: Schedule one full day off weekly, sleep 7-8 hours

6. **Not building skills for the future**
   - Solution: Dedicate 1-2 hours daily to learning

7. **Chasing every opportunity**
   - Solution: After Month 1, focus on your top 3 earners

8. **Poor client communication**
   - Solution: Over-communicate, set clear expectations, deliver early

## 🔥 PRO TIPS FROM SUCCESSFUL USERS

1. **Multi-app delivery**: Run DoorDash + Uber Eats simultaneously (30-50% earnings increase)

2. **Undercut initially**: First 5-10 clients at discount rates for fast reviews, then raise prices

3. **Leverage dead time**: Between deliveries = quick surveys. Waiting for calls = job applications.

4. **Bundle services**: Weekly packages instead of one-offs (recurring income!)

5. **Ask for referrals**: After every great review, ask if they know anyone else

6. **Batch similar tasks**: Write all articles on Sunday, respond to all messages at once

7. **Geographic strategy**: For delivery, learn the best zones and restaurant clusters

8. **Peak timing**: Know when demand spikes (lunch, dinner, Friday nights)

9. **Professional touch**: Even for gig work, be exceptionally communicative and reliable

10. **Reinvest earnings**: 10-20% back into tools, education, and optimization
