**That's okay.**

### The Core Principles Are Universal:

2. **Apply volume** (numbers game)
3. **Track everything**
4. **Optimize continuously**
5. **Raise rates regularly**
6. **Drop low-performers**
7. **Build systems**
8. **Take care of yourself**

### Your Timeline Might Be:

- Faster (some hit $5K in Month 2!)
- Slower (some take 6 months)
- Different (you might skip delivery, focus on writing)

**All valid.**

### What Matters:

Are you **better this week than last week?**

If yes: You're winning.
