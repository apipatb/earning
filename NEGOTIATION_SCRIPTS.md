# Negotiation Scripts & Dialogues
## Exactly What to Say in Every Situation

---

## 💬 HOW TO USE THESE SCRIPTS

**These are proven, word-for-word scripts for common situations.**

### Rules:
1. **Personalize**: Add specific details about your situation
2. **Be genuine**: Don't sound robotic, make it your voice
3. **Stay professional**: Even when client isn't
4. **Practice**: Read out loud before sending

### Format:
- **SITUATION**: When to use this
- **SCRIPT**: Exact words (customize in [brackets])
- **WHY IT WORKS**: Psychology behind it
- **VARIATIONS**: Other ways to say it

---

## 💰 PRICING NEGOTIATIONS

### Script 1: Client Asks "What's Your Rate?"

**SITUATION**: Client asks your rate before sharing budget

**SCRIPT**:
```
"Great question! My rate depends on the scope and complexity of the project.

To give you an accurate quote, could you share:
- What's the timeline?
- How many [deliverables] do you need?
- What's your budget range for this?

This helps me tailor my proposal to your needs. Most projects like this range from $[low] to $[high], depending on those factors.

Looking forward to discussing further!"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Doesn't commit to price first
- Shows professionalism (you price per value, not blanket rate)
- Gets them to reveal budget
- Gives a range (anchoring effect)

**VARIATIONS**:

**More Direct**:
```
"I typically charge $[X] for [specific deliverable]. Could you share a bit more about your project scope and budget so I can give you an exact quote?"
```

**For Hourly Work**:
```
"My hourly rate is $[X]. For a project like this, I estimate it would take [Y] hours, so around $[total]. Does that work with your budget?"
```

---

### Script 2: Client Says "That's Too Expensive"

**SITUATION**: Your quote is above their budget

**SCRIPT - Option A (Flexible)**:
```
"I understand budget is important. Let me ask - what range were you thinking?

Depending on that, we have a few options:
1. We could reduce the scope [explain what you'd remove]
2. We could extend the timeline [explain how that reduces cost]
3. We could do a phased approach [explain priorities]

My goal is to deliver value within your budget. What would work best for you?"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Shows empathy (you understand)
- Doesn't immediately drop price (maintains value)
- Offers alternatives (problem-solving approach)
- Makes them choose (you're still in control)

**SCRIPT - Option B (Hold Firm)**:
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about budget.

My rate reflects [specific value you provide - speed, quality, expertise]. I've found that [result clients get from your work].

That said, I want to be respectful of your budget. If the rate doesn't work, I completely understand and wish you the best with your project!

If you'd like to revisit this in the future when budget allows, I'd be happy to discuss."
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Reinforces your value
- Shows you're not desperate
- Leaves door open
- Often they come back with more budget

**SCRIPT - Option C (Meet in Middle)**:
```
"I see. My standard rate is $[original], which reflects [value].

Here's what I can do: For this first project, I can offer $[middle ground - maybe 15% less], and we can reassess for future work based on results.

Sound fair?"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Small concession (not huge discount)
- Framed as special (one-time)
- Conditional (only for first project)
- Builds relationship

---

### Script 3: When You Need to Raise Rates (Existing Client)

**SITUATION**: You've been working at $X, now worth $Y

**SCRIPT**:
```
Hi [Client Name],

I wanted to give you advance notice about a rate adjustment.

I've really enjoyed working with you over the past [timeframe]. In that time, I've [specific value you've delivered - increased their traffic, saved them time, etc.].

As I've grown my expertise and taken on more clients, I'm adjusting my rates to reflect the value I bring. Effective [date - give 30+ days notice], my rate will be $[new rate] for new projects.

Because I value our working relationship, your current rate of $[old rate] will remain in effect for any projects started before [date].

I'm happy to discuss this if you have any questions. I look forward to continuing our great work together!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Advance notice (respectful)
- Acknowledges relationship
- Justifies increase (value delivered)
- Grandfathers them temporarily (goodwill)
- Professional tone

**VARIATION - For Retainer Clients**:
```
"Hi [Client],

As we approach [renewal date], I wanted to discuss a rate adjustment for the next period.

Since we started, I've [list achievements - 3 specific wins]. The results speak for themselves!

For the next [month/quarter], my rate will be $[new rate], which is [X%] increase and reflects the [complexity/results/market rate].

I believe the value I provide justifies this, but I'm open to discussing if you have any concerns.

Sound good?"
```

---

### Script 4: Client Wants Discount for "Exposure" or "Future Work"

**SITUATION**: "I can't pay much but you'll get great exposure!"

**SCRIPT**:
```
"Thanks for thinking of me!

I appreciate the opportunity, but I don't work for exposure or promises of future work - I've found those rarely materialize.

What I can offer instead:
- My standard rate of $[X] for full scope
- OR reduced scope for your budget (here's what I can do for $[Y])

Happy to discuss what works best for your budget!"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Polite but firm
- Doesn't insult them (but sets boundary)
- Offers alternatives
- Maintains value

**VARIATION - When You Actually Want the Project**:
```
"I love the project, but I can't work for exposure alone.

Here's a compromise: I'll do it for $[reduced rate - but not free], which is 50% off my normal rate. In exchange, I'd like:
- A video testimonial when we're done
- Introduction to 3 potential clients
- Full rights to use it in my portfolio

This way we both get value. Work for you?"
```

---

## 📋 PROJECT SCOPE NEGOTIATIONS

### Script 5: Client Keeps Adding Work ("Scope Creep")

**SITUATION**: Project keeps growing beyond original agreement

**SCRIPT - First Time**:
```
"Hi [Client],

I'm happy to [new request]!

Quick note: This is outside the original scope we agreed to, which was [list original scope].

I can definitely handle this. It would be an additional $[amount] and add [timeframe] to the timeline.

Or, if you'd prefer, we can stick to the original scope and handle this as a separate project after.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Friendly tone (not accusatory)
- Clarifies scope (reminder of original agreement)
- Offers solution
- Makes them decide

**SCRIPT - Repeat Offender**:
```
"Hi [Client],

I notice we've had several additional requests beyond the original scope:
- [Request 1]
- [Request 2]
- [New request]

I want to make sure I'm delivering what you need, but these additions have expanded the project significantly.

Here are two options:
1. We revise the scope and price to $[new total] to include everything
2. We complete the original scope, then start a new project for the additions

Which would you prefer? I'm happy to accommodate either way, but want to make sure we're on the same page."
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Professional (not frustrated)
- Specific (lists the additions)
- Clear options
- Stands firm

---

### Script 6: Client Wants Rush Delivery

**SITUATION**: "Can you do this by tomorrow?"

**SCRIPT - If You Can**:
```
"I can make that work!

For rush delivery (under [X] days notice), I charge a 50% rush fee, so this would be $[original price × 1.5].

If that works for you, I can start immediately and have it to you by [deadline].

Or, if timeline is flexible, I can deliver by [normal timeline] at the standard rate of $[normal price].

Let me know which you prefer!"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- You can say yes (but at premium)
- Teaches them to plan ahead next time
- Gives them choice

**SCRIPT - If You Can't**:
```
"I'd love to help, but unfortunately I'm committed to other clients through [date] and don't want to compromise quality.

The earliest I could deliver this is [realistic date].

If that doesn't work for your timeline, I completely understand! If it does, I'm happy to get started right away."
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Honest
- Protects quality
- Respectful of their needs
- Doesn't over-promise

---

## 🤝 CLIENT MANAGEMENT

### Script 7: Setting Boundaries (Work Hours)

**SITUATION**: Client messages at 11 PM expecting immediate response

**SCRIPT**:
```
"Hi [Client],

Thanks for your message! I wanted to clarify my availability to ensure smooth communication.

My work hours are [9 AM - 6 PM EST, Monday-Friday]. I respond to all messages within [2 hours] during that time.

Messages received outside those hours will get a response by [next morning/next business day].

For true emergencies, you can [specify emergency contact method if any, or say "please include URGENT in subject line"].

This helps me deliver my best work while maintaining quality for all my clients.

Thanks for understanding!"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Professional boundary
- Clear expectations

- Not apologetic (you're allowed to have boundaries!)

---

### Script 8: Client is Rude/Disrespectful

**SITUATION**: Client uses inappropriate language or tone

**SCRIPT - First Warning**:
```
"Hi [Client],

I'm committed to delivering great work for you, and I expect professional communication from both sides.

I'm happy to discuss any concerns you have, but I need us to communicate respectfully.

Let's reset and continue working together productively. What specific issues can I help address?"
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Sets standard
- Doesn't escalate
- Refocuses on solutions
- Gives them chance to correct

**SCRIPT - If It Continues**:
```
"Hi [Client],

After our previous conversation about professional communication, I've noticed [specific behavior].

I don't work in environments where I'm not respected. I'm going to [complete current work/refund and end engagement].

[If completing] I'll deliver [deliverable] by [date], and then we'll part ways.

[If refunding] I'm issuing a full refund and ending the project effective immediately.

I wish you the best with your project."
```

**WHY IT WORKS**:
- Firm
- Professional (even when they're not)
- Clear consequence
- You're firing them (you're not desperate)

---

### Script 9: Client Won't Pay

**SITUATION**: Work delivered, payment not received

**SCRIPT - First Follow-up (Day 1 after due)**:
```
"Hi [Client],

Hope you're well! Just a friendly reminder that payment for [project] was due on [date].

Invoice #[number] for $[amount] is attached.

Could you confirm receipt and expected payment date?

Thanks!
[Your Name]"
```

**SCRIPT - Second Follow-up (Day 7)**:
```
"Hi [Client],

Following up on my previous email about invoice #[number] for $[amount], which was due [date].

I haven't received payment yet. Is there an issue I should know about?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]"
```

**SCRIPT - Final Notice (Day 14)**:
```
"Hi [Client],

This is my final notice regarding unpaid invoice #[number] for $[amount], now [X] days overdue.

If payment is not received by [date - 3 days from now], I will:
1. Suspend all work on current/future projects
2. Report non-payment to [platform if applicable]
3. Pursue payment through [dispute process/small claims court]

I'd prefer to resolve this amicably. Please contact me immediately to arrange payment.

```

This protects both of us and keeps the project moving smoothly.

Sound fair? Happy to discuss if you have a different structure in mind."

## 🎯 QUICK RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### When Client Asks for Free Sample/Trial

```
"I don't offer free trials, but I'm happy to share my portfolio and client testimonials so you can see the quality of my work. Would that help?"
```

### When Client Wants to "Think About It"

```
"Of course, take your time! Just so you know, I have availability starting [date]. If you'd like to move forward, let me know by [date] to secure that slot. Otherwise I'll check back in [timeframe]."
```

### When Asked "What Makes You Different?"

```
"Great question. Three things:
1. [Specific skill/speed/quality]
2. [Communication/reliability]
3. [Result they'll get]

Here's what one client said: [brief testimonial]

Want to discuss how I can help with your specific project?"
```

### When Client Ghosts Then Returns

1. [Question]
2. [Question]
3. [Question]

Once I have that info, I can send over a proposal within 24 hours."
```

---

## 🧠 NEGOTIATION PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Anchor High**
First number mentioned sets the "anchor"
- If they ask your rate first: Give top of your range
- If they give budget first: Aim for 10-20% above

### 2. **Never Justify Lower, Always Justify Higher**
- ❌ "I can do it cheaper because I'm new"
- ✅ "My rate is higher because I deliver X, Y, Z"

### 3. **Make Them Choose**
Don't just say yes or no - offer options
- "We can do A for $X or B for $Y"
- Makes you look flexible
- They feel in control

### 4. **Silence is Power**
After you state your price: SHUT UP
- Don't fill the silence
- Let them respond first
- Whoever speaks first often "loses"

### 5. **Bundle for Perceived Value**
- "4 articles for $400" sounds better than "$100/article"
- "Monthly package" sounds premium vs. "hourly rate"

### 6. **Use "I" Statements, Not "You"**
- ❌ "You're asking for too much work"
- ✅ "I can't deliver quality at that scope/price"

### 7. **End with Question**
Forces them to engage
- "Does that work for you?"
- "What would you prefer?"
- "Sound fair?"

---

## ⚠️ RED FLAGS: When to Walk Away

### These phrases mean trouble:

**"We'll pay more next time"**
→ They won't. Get paid fairly now.

**"Everyone else charges less"**
→ Let them hire "everyone else." Don't compete on price.

**"This will be great exposure"**
→ Exposure doesn't pay bills.

**"We need to see your work first" (free)**
→ Your portfolio is the sample. Don't work for free.

**"My budget is $X" (insultingly low)**
→ "Thanks, but I can't deliver quality at that rate. Good luck!"

**"Can you start now?" (before discussing pay/scope)**
→ "Let's discuss scope and budget first."

### Walk Away If:

- They disrespect you
- They keep changing scope without adjusting pay
- They want spec work (you compete for free)
- They refuse to put agreement in writing
- Your gut says no

**Remember**: There are always more clients. Protect your time and value.

---

## 🎯 FINAL TIPS

### Before Every Negotiation:

1. **Know your bottom line** (what's your walk-away point?)
2. **Know their motivation** (why do they need this?)
3. **Have alternatives ready** (other clients, other options)
4. **Practice out loud** (sounds different than in your head)
5. **Remember**: You're solving their problem (you have value!)

### During Negotiation:

1. **Listen more than talk** (understand what they really need)
2. **Ask questions** (more info = more power)
3. **Take your time** ("Let me check my schedule and get back to you")
4. **Stay professional** (emotion loses deals)
5. **Be willing to walk** (desperation shows)

### After Negotiation:

1. **Get it in writing** (email confirmation minimum)
2. **Clarify everything** (scope, timeline, payment, revisions)
3. **Start strong** (first impression sets tone)
4. **Deliver more than promised** (want them to say "worth every penny")

---

## 💪 CONFIDENCE BUILDERS

### When You Feel Scared to Negotiate:

**Remember**:
- The worst they can say is no (you're no worse off)
- If they hired you, they NEED you (you have value)
- Professional negotiation is expected (not rude)
- You can't get what you don't ask for
- Every "no" teaches you something

**Mantras**:
- "I provide value and deserve fair compensation"
- "There are always more clients"
- "Professional boundaries make better relationships"
- "I'm running a business, not a charity"
- "I'm worth what I charge"
