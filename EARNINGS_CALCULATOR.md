## 🎓 PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMIZING EARNINGS

1. **Focus on $/Hour, Not Total $**
   - $200 for 5 hours ($40/hr) beats $300 for 10 hours ($30/hr)

2. **Calculate "All-In" Time**
   - Include commute, prep, admin time in your hourly rate calculation

3. **Track Hidden Costs**
   - Platform fees, gas, tools - reduce your effective rate

4. **Optimize for Efficiency**
   - 10% faster = 10% more earnings in same time

5. **Raise Rates Regularly**
   - Most people wait too long - raise every 10-20 jobs

6. **Bundle for Higher Value**
   - $500 package feels better than $50/hour

7. **Track Everything**
   - Can't optimize what you don't measure
