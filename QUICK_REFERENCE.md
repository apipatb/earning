1. **Trying to do everything at once** → Start with 3-4 platforms
2. **Not tracking time/earnings** → Can't optimize what you don't measure
3. **Staying at beginner rates too long** → Raise rates every 20 reviews
4. **Ignoring taxes** → Set aside money from Day 1
5. **Burning out** → Schedule one full day off per week
6. **Not building skills** → Always be learning one new thing
